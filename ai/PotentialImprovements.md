## SQLite Database for ProjectStatusBoard Archiving (Option 1: Hybrid Approach)

### **Concept**
- **Current**: Keep markdown for active issues (human-readable)
- **Archive**: Move to SQLite for historical data (queryable)
- **Best of both**: Human-readable current state + powerful historical analysis

### **Pros**
- **Structured Data**: Enforce consistent schema across all archived issues
- **Advanced Querying**: Complex searches like "all backend issues from last week with high priority"
- **Performance**: Fast queries even with thousands of archived issues
- **Analytics**: Generate reports on project velocity, issue patterns, team performance
- **Integration**: API endpoints for programmatic access to historical data
- **Scalability**: Handle massive amounts of historical data efficiently

### **Cons**
- **Complexity Overhead**: Schema design, migration scripts, database setup
- **Learning Curve**: Agents need to understand SQL queries and database operations
- **Operational Burden**: Database maintenance, backup strategies, error handling
- **Human Readability**: Archive data not directly viewable like markdown files
- **Git Integration**: Database changes don't work well with version control
- **Debugging**: Database issues harder to diagnose than file issues

### **When to Consider**
- **Enterprise-scale** AI agent teams (hundreds of issues per week)
- **Complex reporting requirements** (velocity metrics, pattern analysis)
- **Multiple concurrent teams** requiring advanced filtering
- **Long-term project analysis** needs

### **Implementation Notes**
- Keep current markdown approach for active issues (under 200 lines)
- Only archive resolved issues to SQLite database
- Provide simple query interface for common historical searches
- Generate markdown reports from database for human review when needed
