## Recent Decisions
- [2024-07-07] **COMPLETED**: First-run initialization process (Issue #130) - Backend delivered SystemConfig model, setup endpoints, middleware, and conditional seed script. All unit tests passing. Production deployment is now unblocked.
- [2024-12-20] **NEW ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: First-run initialization process needed (#130) - Users cannot log in after deployment because no admin account exists. Need secure setup flow with one-time-only access. Updated ProductVision.md and API_CONTRACT.md with setup requirements.
- [2024-12-20] **VERIFICATION COMPLETE**: AIPM conducted comprehensive verification of frontend and backend teams' work. All claims verified and confirmed accurate. Found 256/256 unit tests passing (100% success rate). Security issue #129 resolved. E2E test configuration fixed. No falsifications or mistakes found.

### 2024-07-07
- [COMPLETED] #130 First-run initialization process - Backend delivered SystemConfig model, setup endpoints, middleware, and conditional seed script. All unit tests passing. Production deployment is now unblocked.

### 2024-12-20
- [UPDATED] Admin credentials changed from loKonoma!!!!!11111 to kmToDo1!1! for better security and naming consistency. Updated prisma/seed.ts and README.md. Database successfully seeded with new credentials and comprehensive sample data (3 projects, 10 todos, 3 time logs, 1 recurring pattern, 3 messages).
- [RESOLVED] #122 '+ Add Todo' button does not work in project todos view - Implemented missing functionality for the Add Todo button in project detail page. Button now opens TodoModal with project context pre-filled. Users can add todos directly from project view. Added comprehensive unit tests (24/24 passing).
- [RESOLVED] Login issue after database seeding - Fixed cookie configuration in src/lib/auth.ts. Changed SameSite from 'none' to 'lax' for localhost development. This resolved 401 Unauthorized errors in browser and allows successful login with admin@example.com / kmToDo1!1!.
- [RESOLVED] #121 Missing edit/delete actions in project list views - Implemented comprehensive CRUD actions for todos, members, and messages in project detail page. Added edit/delete buttons with proper modals and confirmation dialogs. All list views now have consistent UX patterns.
- [RESOLVED] #120 Next.js 15 params Promise build error - Fixed by awaiting params Promise in API route for Next.js 15 compatibility
- [RESOLVED] #119 Main content/sidebar vertical misalignment - Fixed by refactoring AuthenticatedLayout to use flex row at root. Sidebar and main content are now flush to the top, responsive, and accessible.

**Focus**: Analytics and enhanced UX
**Duration**: 1-2 weeks remaining
**Teams**: Backend (analytics APIs), Frontend (UX improvements)

### Next Milestones
1. **Priority 1**: Analytics API endpoints implementation
2. **Priority 2**: Enhanced UX features and improvements

### Communication Protocol
- **Backend Team**: Update BackEndStatus.md with progress and blockers
- **Frontend Team**: Update FrontEndStatus.md with progress and blockers
- **All Teams**: Log major issues, contract changes, and integration events in this file
- **AIPM Agent**: Curate this file, maintain summaries, and enforce format

### Contract Compliance
- All implementations must follow API_CONTRACT.md specifications
- Any contract changes must be logged here with justification
- Frontend and backend teams coordinate through the contract file
- Integration testing validates contract compliance

### Authentication System Status
