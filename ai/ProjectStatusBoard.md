**Current Reality:**
- **Unit Tests**: 243/246 passing (98.8% success rate)
- **E2E Tests**: 125 configured but not executing properly
- **Total Test Files**: 18 test files (4 failing, 14 passing)

### 🎯 **RECOMMENDATIONS**

1. **Immediate Fixes**: Address the 3 failing tests before proceeding
2. **Test Environment**: Review and fix test configuration issues
3. **E2E Testing**: Resolve Playwright configuration problems
4. **Documentation Update**: Update ProjectStatusBoard.md with accurate test results
5. **Quality Assurance**: Implement better test validation before marking as complete

### 📝 **CONCLUSION**

The frontend and backend teams have done substantial work, but there are **significant discrepancies** between the claimed test results and actual test execution. The core functionality appears to be working, but the test infrastructure has issues that need immediate attention. The teams should focus on fixing the failing tests and E2E configuration before proceeding with new features.

**Status**: ⚠️ **WORK IN PROGRESS** - Core functionality complete, but test reliability issues need resolution.
