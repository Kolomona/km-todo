#### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Backend Team)
- [ ] Create Playwright configuration file (`playwright.config.ts`)
- [ ] Set up test database configuration for E2E tests
- [ ] Implement test data seeding/reset functionality
- [ ] Configure environment variables for E2E testing

#### Phase 2: Test Structure Setup (Frontend Team)

- [ ] Project management E2E tests (CRUD operations)
- [ ] Todo management E2E tests (CRUD, time tracking)
- [ ] User workflow integration tests

#### Phase 4: Validation & Documentation (AIPM)

     - "test:e2e:debug": "playwright test --debug"

3. **Test Implementation Priority**
   1. Authentication Tests - Login, register, logout workflows
   2. Project Management Tests - CRUD operations, member management
   3. Todo Management Tests - CRUD operations, time tracking, filtering
   4. Integration Tests - Cross-feature workflows

### Test Coverage Requirements

#### Authentication Workflows
- User registration with validation
- User login with remember me functionality
- User logout and session cleanup
- Protected route access
