## Development Workflow Notes

### Current Phase: Phase 2 - Core Features
**Focus**: Project and todo management systems
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks
**Teams**: Backend (project/todo APIs), Frontend (project/todo UI)

### Next Milestones
1. **Backend Priority**: Implement project CRUD operations (#105)
2. **Backend Priority**: Build todo management system (#107)
3. **Frontend Priority**: Build authentication UI components (#103)
4. **Frontend Priority**: Implement responsive layout (#104)
5. **Integration**: Complete testing framework (#106)

### Communication Protocol
- **Backend Team**: Update BackEndStatus.md with progress and blockers
- **Frontend Team**: Update FrontEndStatus.md with progress and blockers
- **All Teams**: Log major issues, contract changes, and integration events in this file
- **AIPM Agent**: Curate this file, maintain summaries, and enforce format

### Contract Compliance
- All implementations must follow API_CONTRACT.md specifications
- Any contract changes must be logged here with justification
- Frontend and backend teams coordinate through the contract file
- Integration testing validates contract compliance

### Authentication System Status
- âœ… **User Registration**: POST /api/auth/register with validation
- âœ… **User Login**: POST /api/auth/login with password verification
- âœ… **User Logout**: POST /api/auth/logout with session cleanup
- âœ… **Current User**: GET /api/auth/me with session validation
- âœ… **Session Management**: Database-backed sessions with 30-day expiry
- âœ… **Security**: Password hashing, input validation, secure cookies
