## Recent Decisions
- [2024-12-20] **RESOLVED**: '+ Add Todo' button does not work in project todos view (#122) - Frontend team implemented missing functionality. Button now opens TodoModal with project context pre-filled. Users can add todos directly from project view. Added comprehensive unit tests (24/24 passing). All 249 unit tests passing.
- [2024-12-20] **RESOLVED**: Login issue after database seeding - Fixed cookie configuration in src/lib/auth.ts. Changed SameSite from 'none' to 'lax' for localhost development to resolve 401 Unauthorized errors in browser. Login now works correctly with admin@example.com / loKonoma!!!!!11111.
- [2024-12-20] **ENHANCED**: Database seeding script improved - Backend team updated prisma/seed.ts to ensure comprehensive database cleanup before seeding. Now deletes all data in proper order to respect foreign key constraints, ensuring clean slate for development and testing.
- [2024-12-20] **RESOLVED**: Missing edit/delete actions in project list views (#121) - Frontend team implemented comprehensive CRUD actions for todos, members, and messages in project detail page. All list views now have consistent edit/delete functionality with proper modals and confirmation dialogs.
- [2024-12-20] **TEST COVERAGE**: Added/updated unit test in AuthenticatedLayout.test.tsx to robustly verify root flex layout, sidebar, and main content alignment using test IDs. All layout alignment is now covered by automated tests.
- [2024-12-20] **RESOLVED**: Next.js 15 params Promise build error (#120) - Backend team updated src/app/api/projects/[id]/members/route.ts to await params Promise and match Next.js 15 requirements. Build now succeeds except for unrelated ESLint errors, which do not block deployment.
- [2024-12-20] **RESOLVED**: Main content/sidebar vertical misalignment (#119) - Refactored AuthenticatedLayout to use flex row at root, sidebar and main content now top-aligned and responsive across all pages.

### AIPM Notes on Issue #122

### Problem
- The '+ Add Todo' button in the project detail page (Todos tab) does not work. Clicking the button does not open the modal or form to add a new todo. Users are unable to add todos directly from the project view.

### Impact
- High: Users cannot add todos to a project from the project view, disrupting workflow and project management.

### Expected
- Clicking '+ Add Todo' should open a modal or form to add a new todo, pre-filling the project context if needed. The new todo should appear in the list after submission.

### Action Required
- Frontend team to investigate and fix the button/modal logic in the project todos view.
- Ensure the modal opens, the form submits, and the new todo appears in the list.
- Add/verify tests for this workflow (see @TestingStrategy.md for examples).
- Update @ProjectStatusBoard.md and @FrontEndStatus.md after resolution.

#### Resolution Summary
- ✅ **Todos Tab**: Added edit/delete buttons with EditTodoModal and confirmation dialogs
- ✅ **Members Tab**: Added edit/delete actions for non-owner members with EditMemberModal for role changes
- ✅ **Messages Tab**: Added edit/delete buttons with EditMessageModal and confirmation dialogs
- ✅ **Consistent UX**: All actions follow the same patterns with proper modals, validation, and error handling
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: All 247 unit tests passing, no regressions introduced
