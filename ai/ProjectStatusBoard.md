## Recent Decisions
- [2024-12-19] Project structure: Next.js 15 with React 19, PostgreSQL, Prisma, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- [2024-12-19] Architecture: Full-stack approach with API routes, no separate backend server
- [2024-12-19] Authentication: Session-based with cookies, no JWT tokens
- [2024-12-19] Database: PostgreSQL with Docker containerization
- [2024-12-19] Development approach: AI Agent Full-Stack Development with contract-driven methodology
- [2024-12-19] Testing strategy: Comprehensive testing with Vitest (unit/integration) and Playwright (E2E)

## Archive
*No archived issues yet - project just initialized*

*No more than 10 archived issues should remain in this section. Older issues must be moved to a separate archive file (e.g., ProjectStatusBoard-Archive-2024-12.md).*

## Development Workflow Notes

### Current Phase: Phase 1 - Core Foundation
**Focus**: Basic application structure and authentication
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks
**Teams**: Backend (database schema, auth APIs), Frontend (auth UI, basic layout)

### Next Milestones
1. **Backend Priority**: Implement Prisma database schema (#101)
2. **Backend Priority**: Create authentication API endpoints (#102)
3. **Frontend Priority**: Build authentication UI components (#103)
4. **Frontend Priority**: Implement responsive layout (#104)
5. **Integration**: Test API contract compliance (#105)

### Communication Protocol
- **Backend Team**: Update BackEndStatus.md with progress and blockers
- **Frontend Team**: Update FrontEndStatus.md with progress and blockers
- **All Teams**: Log major issues, contract changes, and integration events in this file
- **AIPM Agent**: Curate this file, maintain summaries, and enforce format

### Contract Compliance
- All implementations must follow API_CONTRACT.md specifications
- Any contract changes must be logged here with justification
- Frontend and backend teams coordinate through the contract file
- Integration testing validates contract compliance
