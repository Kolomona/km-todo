## Development Workflow Notes

### Current Phase: Phase 2 - Core Features
**Focus**: Project and todo management systems
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks
**Teams**: Backend (project/todo APIs), Frontend (project/todo UI)

### Next Milestones
1. **Backend Priority**: Fix registration endpoint test issues (#108)
2. **Backend Priority**: Implement project CRUD operations (#105)
3. **Backend Priority**: Build todo management system (#107)
4. **Frontend Priority**: Build project & todo UI components (#110)
5. **Integration**: Complete E2E testing setup (#109)

### Communication Protocol
- **Backend Team**: Update BackEndStatus.md with progress and blockers
- **Frontend Team**: Update FrontEndStatus.md with progress and blockers
- **All Teams**: Log major issues, contract changes, and integration events in this file
- **AIPM Agent**: Curate this file, maintain summaries, and enforce format

### Contract Compliance
- All implementations must follow API_CONTRACT.md specifications
- Any contract changes must be logged here with justification
- Frontend and backend teams coordinate through the contract file
- Integration testing validates contract compliance
