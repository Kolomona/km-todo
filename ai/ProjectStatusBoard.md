## Development Workflow Notes

### Current Phase: Phase 2 - Core Features (Project Management Complete)
**Focus**: Todo management system and enhanced UX
**Duration**: 1-2 weeks remaining
**Teams**: Backend (todo APIs), Frontend (todo UI)

### Next Milestones
1. **Backend Priority**: Implement Todo CRUD operations (#107)
2. **Frontend Priority**: Build todo management UI components (#111)
3. **Integration**: Complete E2E testing setup (#109)

### Database Seeding Requirements (#112)
**VERIFIED**: `prisma/seed.ts` script creates:
- Admin user: `admin@example.com` / `loKonoma!!!!!11111`

- 10 todos with various priorities/statuses
- Admin as owner member of all projects
- 3 project messages
- 3 time logs
- 1 recurring todo
