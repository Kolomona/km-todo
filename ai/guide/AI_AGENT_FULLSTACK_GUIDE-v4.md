# AI Agent Full-Stack Development Guide v4
## Building Complete Web Applications with AI Teams

*Streamlined guide for building full-stack web applications using multiple AI agents with contract-driven development, explicit project management, and production-grade workflows.*

> **Note for Human Readers**: Throughout this document, `@` symbols are used before filename references (e.g., `@API_CONTRACT.md`) to help AI agents better understand file relationships and importance. These `@` symbols are **not part of the actual filenames** - they are only used in this documentation for AI interpretability. Actual filenames do not have `@` prefixes.

## Quick Start

1. **Create Project Structure**
   ```
   your-project/
   ├── ai/
   │   ├── ProductVision.md           # Business plan & requirements
   │   ├── API_CONTRACT.md            # Living contract (frontend ↔ backend)
   │   ├── ProjectStatusBoard.md      # Integration & ticketing system
   │   ├── FrontEndStatus.md          # Frontend progress log
   │   ├── BackEndStatus.md           # Backend progress log
   │   ├── TestingStrategy.md         # Testing guidelines & examples
   │
   │   └── archives/                  # Archived status boards
   ```

2. **Use AI Agent Context Primer** (paste at start of each conversation)
   ```
   # Project Context Primer
   You are an AI agent working as part of a multi-agent, contract-driven development team.
   
   - @API_CONTRACT.md = single source of truth for endpoints & data models
   - @ProjectStatusBoard.md = integration & ticketing (max 5 open issues, 200 lines)
   - All agents write to @ProjectStatusBoard.md for issues/decisions
   - AIPM agent curates @ProjectStatusBoard.md format & archives
   - Check @ProjectStatusBoard.md, @API_CONTRACT.md, @TestingStrategy.md before starting
   - If @ProjectStatusBoard.md exceeds 200 lines, create issue for AIPM to archive
   
   Your role: [Backend/Frontend/AIPM]
   Your scope: [Define specific responsibilities]
   ```

3. **Development Cycle**
   ```
   Setup Tech Stack → Update Contract → Backend Implementation → Frontend Implementation → 
   Integration Testing → AIPM Summary → Repeat
   ```
   
   **💡 Workflow Note**: Run agents sequentially, not simultaneously. While parallel development seems efficient, it leads to integration complexity and contract mismatches.

## Core Concepts

### The Problem
Single AI development results in:
- ❌ Integration issues (frontend/backend mismatch)
- ❌ Inconsistent code patterns
- ❌ Missing features & quality problems

### The Solution: AI Agent Teams
- **🤖 Backend AI**: Server-side code, databases, APIs
- **🎨 Frontend AI**: UI, styling, user experience  
- **📋 AIPM Agent**: Coordination, summary, file curation
- **👤 Human PM**: Strategic decisions & validation

**💡 Key Insight**: Run agents sequentially, not simultaneously. While it's tempting to have frontend and backend work at the same time, this becomes too complicated and leads to integration issues. Sequential workflow (Backend → Frontend → Integration) produces better results.

### Contract-Driven Method
**@API_CONTRACT.md** = living blueprint defining:
- Data models & formats
- Frontend/backend communication
- Team responsibilities
- Error handling & edge cases

**@ProjectStatusBoard.md** = streamlined integration system:
- Max 5 open issues (enforced by human PM)
- Max 200 lines (enforced by AIPM)
- Immediate archiving of resolved issues
- Archive files in `ai/archives/` with standardized naming

---

## Project Setup

### Step 0: Tech Stack Foundation (Recommended)
**Best results are achieved when you start with a skeleton project for your chosen tech stack:**
- **Next.js**: `npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind --eslint`
- **SvelteKit**: `npm create svelte@latest my-app`
- **Nuxt 3**: `npx nuxi@latest init my-app`
- **Vue + Vite**: `npm create vue@latest my-app`
- **React + Vite**: `npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react-ts`
- **Express + TypeScript**: Use a starter template with Express, TypeScript, and testing setup

**Benefits of starting with a skeleton:**
- ✅ Pre-configured build tools, testing, and linting
- ✅ Proper TypeScript setup and type checking
- ✅ Database connections and ORM already configured
- ✅ Authentication boilerplate available
- ✅ AI agents can focus on business logic, not setup
- ✅ Faster development and fewer configuration issues

### Step 1: Business Foundation
Create @ProductVision.md with:
- Market analysis & competitive review
- Target users & business goals
- User stories & feature list
- Technical requirements & architecture
- Data models & key algorithms
- Success metrics & risk assessment

**💡 Hint**: After having an AI read this document, you can ask it to give you a questionnaire to answer, then it can generate @ProductVision.md for you 🙂

### Step 2: Generate Foundation Files
Use AIPM prompt:
```
"Read @ProductVision.md and generate all foundational files:
1. @API_CONTRACT.md - Detailed, living contract
2. @FrontEndStatus.md - Frontend progress tracking
3. @BackEndStatus.md - Backend progress tracking  
4. @ProjectStatusBoard.md - Integration & ticketing system
5. @TestingStrategy.md - Testing guidelines & examples


Comment each file with purpose and usage instructions."
```

### Step 3: Review & Refine
- ✅ API contract covers all features?
- ✅ Data models correct & contract-compliant?
- ✅ Instructions & protocols clear?
- ✅ Project structure follows guide specifications?

## Archive (Line-Count Based)
### Current Archive
- [RESOLVED] #100 MenuItem.price migration complete
- [RESOLVED] #99 Dashboard loading state fixed

*Note: When this file exceeds 200 lines, older resolved issues will be moved to archive files.*
```

### Archiving Workflow

**When @ProjectStatusBoard.md exceeds 200 lines:**
  1. AIPM creates new archive file: `ai/archives/ProjectStatusBoard-Archive-YY-MM-DD-XXX.md`
2. Moves oldest resolved issues to archive
3. Updates @ProjectStatusBoard.md to remove archived items
4. Maintains same 5-section structure in archive files

**Archive File Discovery:**
- AI agents use `ls -l ai/archives/` to find relevant files
- Archive files maintain same structure for AI readability
- Complex historical research handled by human PM when needed

## Best Practices

### Contract Management
✅ **Do:**
- Keep API contract as single source of truth
- Update contract before implementing new features
- Use clear, consistent naming conventions (camelCase)
- Log all contract changes in @ProjectStatusBoard.md

❌ **Don't:**
- Implement features without updating contract
- Let contract become outdated
- Use inconsistent data formats

### Team Coordination
✅ **Do:**
- Update status files after each session
- Communicate through contract & @ProjectStatusBoard.md
- Test integration regularly with E2E tests
- Keep sessions focused on specific features

❌ **Don't:**
- Work on features not in contract
- Skip status updates
- Assume other team knows your changes

### Quality Assurance
✅ **Do:**
- Test features after implementation
- Validate against contract
- Check accessibility & responsiveness
- Require E2E tests with test data seeding/reset
- Log all test results in @ProjectStatusBoard.md

❌ **Don't:**
- Skip testing
- Ignore contract violations
- Overlook user experience

### Human Oversight
✅ **Do:**
- Review AI-generated code
- Make strategic decisions about features
- Validate requirements are met
- Use @ProjectStatusBoard.md as single source of truth

❌ **Don't:**
- Let AI make all decisions
- Skip human validation
- Ignore business requirements
