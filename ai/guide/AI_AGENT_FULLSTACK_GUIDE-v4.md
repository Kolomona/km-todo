## Quick Start

1. **Create Project Structure**
   ```
   your-project/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ai/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ProductVision.md           # Business plan & requirements
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ API_CONTRACT.md            # Living contract (frontend ‚Üî backend)
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ProjectStatusBoard.md      # Integration & ticketing system
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FrontEndStatus.md          # Frontend progress log
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BackEndStatus.md           # Backend progress log
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TestingStrategy.md         # Testing guidelines & examples
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GitVersionControlStrategy.md # Git workflow & conventions
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ archives/                  # Archived status boards
   ```

2. **Use AI Agent Context Primer** (paste at start of each conversation)
   ```
   # Project Context Primer
   You are an AI agent working as part of a multi-agent, contract-driven development team.
   
   - @API_CONTRACT.md = single source of truth for endpoints & data models
   - @ProjectStatusBoard.md = integration & ticketing (max 5 open issues, 200 lines)
   - All agents write to @ProjectStatusBoard.md for issues/decisions
   - AIPM agent curates @ProjectStatusBoard.md format & archives
   - Check @ProjectStatusBoard.md, @API_CONTRACT.md, @TestingStrategy.md before starting
   - If @ProjectStatusBoard.md exceeds 200 lines, create issue for AIPM to archive
   
   Your role: [Backend/Frontend/AIPM]
   Your scope: [Define specific responsibilities]
   ```

3. **Development Cycle**
   ```
   Update Contract ‚Üí Backend Implementation ‚Üí Frontend Implementation ‚Üí 
   Integration Testing ‚Üí AIPM Summary ‚Üí Repeat
   ```

## Core Concepts

### The Problem
Single AI development results in:
- ‚ùå Integration issues (frontend/backend mismatch)
- ‚ùå Inconsistent code patterns
- ‚ùå Missing features & quality problems

### The Solution: AI Agent Teams
- **ü§ñ Backend AI**: Server-side code, databases, APIs
- **üé® Frontend AI**: UI, styling, user experience  
- **üìã AIPM Agent**: Coordination, summary, file curation
- **üë§ Human PM**: Strategic decisions & validation

### Contract-Driven Method
**@API_CONTRACT.md** = living blueprint defining:
- Data models & formats
- Frontend/backend communication
- Team responsibilities
- Error handling & edge cases

**@ProjectStatusBoard.md** = streamlined integration system:
- Max 5 open issues (enforced by human PM)
- Max 200 lines (enforced by AIPM)
- Immediate archiving of resolved issues
- Archive files in `ai/archives/` with standardized naming

---

## Project Setup

### Step 1: Business Foundation
Create @ProductVision.md with:
- Market analysis & competitive review
- Target users & business goals
- User stories & feature list
- Technical requirements & architecture
- Data models & key algorithms
- Success metrics & risk assessment

### Step 2: Generate Foundation Files
Use AIPM prompt:
```
"Read @ProductVision.md and generate all foundational files:
1. @API_CONTRACT.md - Detailed, living contract
2. @DevelopmentPlan.md - Roadmap with phases
3. @FrontEndStatus.md - Frontend progress tracking
4. @BackEndStatus.md - Backend progress tracking  
5. @ProjectStatusBoard.md - Integration & ticketing system
6. @TestingStrategy.md - Testing guidelines & examples
7. @GitVersionControlStrategy.md - Git workflow & conventions

Comment each file with purpose and usage instructions."
```

### Step 3: Review & Refine
- ‚úÖ API contract covers all features?
- ‚úÖ Data models correct & contract-compliant?
- ‚úÖ Phases make sense?
- ‚úÖ Instructions & protocols clear?

## ProjectStatusBoard.md Structure

### Efficient Format (Max 200 Lines)

```markdown
# @ProjectStatusBoard.md

## Current Status (Top 5 Issues)
| ID | Area | Issue | Status | Owner | Priority |
|----|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|
| #101 | Backend | Analytics endpoints missing | Open | Backend | High |
| #102 | Frontend | Mobile responsive issues | In Progress | Frontend | Medium |

## Recent Decisions (Last 5)
- [2024-07-04] Contract updated: all payloads use camelCase
- [2024-07-03] Playwright E2E required for new features

## Test Results Summary
- Frontend: 254/256 passing (99.2%)
- Backend: 73/73 passing (100%)
- E2E: 3/3 passing (100%)

## Next Milestones
1. Priority 1: Complete analytics API endpoints
2. Priority 2: Fix mobile responsive issues
3. Priority 3: Implement real-time features

## Archive (Line-Count Based)
### Current Archive
- [RESOLVED] #100 MenuItem.price migration complete
- [RESOLVED] #99 Dashboard loading state fixed

*Note: When this file exceeds 200 lines, older resolved issues will be moved to archive files.*
```

### Archiving Workflow

**When @ProjectStatusBoard.md exceeds 200 lines:**
  1. AIPM creates new archive file: `ai/archives/ProjectStatusBoard-Archive-YY-MM-DD-XXX.md`
2. Moves oldest resolved issues to archive
3. Updates @ProjectStatusBoard.md to remove archived items
4. Maintains same 5-section structure in archive files

**Archive File Discovery:**
- AI agents use `ls -l ai/archives/` to find relevant files
- Archive files maintain same structure for AI readability
- Complex historical research handled by human PM when needed

- Let contract become outdated
- Use inconsistent data formats

### Team Coordination
‚úÖ **Do:**
- Update status files after each session
- Communicate through contract & @ProjectStatusBoard.md
- Test integration regularly with E2E tests
- Keep sessions focused on specific features

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Work on features not in contract
- Skip status updates
- Assume other team knows your changes

### Quality Assurance
‚úÖ **Do:**
- Test features after implementation
- Validate against contract
- Check accessibility & responsiveness
- Require E2E tests with test data seeding/reset
- Log all test results in @ProjectStatusBoard.md

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Skip testing
- Ignore contract violations
- Overlook user experience

### Human Oversight
‚úÖ **Do:**
- Review AI-generated code
- Make strategic decisions about features
- Validate requirements are met
- Use @ProjectStatusBoard.md as single source of truth

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Let AI make all decisions
- Skip human validation
- Ignore business requirements
